* Folders labelled "hardBC" use a hard constraint to enforce the boundary conditions (BC). This is done by multplying the MLP output by sin(x) functions that equal zero on the boundaries

* Folders labelled "hardBC2" use a hard BC constraint by multiplying the MLB output by 4x(1-x) functions, which equal zero at the boundaries x=0 and x=1.
